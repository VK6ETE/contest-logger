# Contesting Software
Amateur Radio contesting is a particular activity where hobbyists get on air and exchange information and log the exchange. Sometimes that exchange is made as part of an activity, called contesting, where points are awarded for each such exchange.

There are many tools that provide contest logging. At this time there are no tools that provide the following functionality.

## Cross Platform
- must be cross platform, as-in, you should be able to use it on whatever computer you have access to, a Linux workstation, a Macintosh Laptop, an Android Phone or tablet, Windows, iOS and a Raspberry Pi. In other words, there shouldn't be a situation where you cannot run the tool because you have some random combination of operating system or CPU that the developer doesn't support.

## Open Source
- must be open source and the code should be available to the entire community. There are too many stories of great tools dying or being held hostage by individuals or small groups. The tool should continue to exist and be usable regardless of the participation of the original developer. Users should be able to fix things, add functionality, change themes, whatever.

## Customisable
- must be customisable, because not every contest needs the same information. For example, the John Moyle Memorial Field Day, a contest run every year during March in Australia requires that VHF and UHF contacts record the maidenhead locator, a four or six character message that designates the location of the station. This is used to calculate distance between two stations and award points accordingly. Such a requirement isn't needed in most other contests.

## Optional Fields
- must be able to disable fields. Some contests are considered friendly contests, like the Remembrance Day contest in August. It's common to exchange your name and have a chat. You'd be unpopular if you used that approach for the Oceania DX, the CQ World Wide or the CQ WPX contests. In other words, some fields are expected for some contests, but not for others.

## Live Validation
- must support live validation be able to show if a contact if valid by whatever means the rules for a particular contest decide.

## Automatic Time Logging
- must automatically log time with the ability to manually override.
- logging must be in UTC.

## Editing Contacts
- must provide a mechanism to edit a contact after it has been logged.

## Contact History
- track previous entries and present data from previous contacts

## Super Check Partial
- should support the super check partial list to validate partial callsigns.

## Accessibility
- must be able to use either a keyboard or mouse, or both, to do all the common contesting data entry. No dependence on crazy keyboard shortcuts, no requirement to click the mouse to make an entry, in other words, the tool needs to be able to get out of the way of the user.

## Extensible
- must have the ability to add contest rules, using a versionned plug-in system that can be authored by inexperienced users or contest managers.

## Exports
- must export data in whatever format the contest organiser expects.

## Usable Offline
- must be usable without needing to be connected to the internet during the contest.

## Updates
- must provide an update mechanism and be easy to update.

## Station Log
- should have the ability to keep a station log of all the contacts ever made.

## Imports
- would be great if it could also import existing logs so you can start to consolidate older logs.
